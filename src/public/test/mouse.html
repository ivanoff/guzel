This page contains a script for testing the events fired in
different browsers when a <a href="/test/mouse2.html">mouse 2</a> click occurs.  Click on the
"click here to test" link to see the events fired by the click.
<a href="/test/package.txt" download>package.json</a>
<p>
This script will capture and log the following event types:
<ul>
<li> mousedown - the mouse button goes down.
<li> mouseup - the mouse button goes up.
<li> click - a logical mouse click.
<li> dblclick - a logical mouse double click has occured.
<li> contextmenu - a context menu has been triggered.
</ul>
We do not consider mouseover, mouseoff or mousemove events here.
<p>
Different browsers generate different events in different orders.
For each event, the script will give the values of the <tt>event.which</tt>
and <tt>event.button</tt> variables, which indicate which mouse button
was clicked.
<p>
Try left clicks, right clicks, and middle clicks.
Try double clicks.
<p>
Every attempt has been made to disable the default actions of mouse clicks
when clicking on the test link.
However, in some browsers, the defaults cannot be disabled, so various
strange side effects may occur.
<p>
    In a correctly working browser, only clicks on the link should be logged in
    the window, and default actions should still occur if the same mouse buttons
    are clicked on other parts of the screen.  Not all browsers work correctly.

<p>
This page sets up event handlers with the old Level 0 DOM.
There are also versions of this page that use the
standard
<a href="testmouse-2.html">Level 2 addEventListener function</a>.
or with the
<a href="testmouse-ie.html">IE attachEvent</a> function.
<p>
See <a href="http://unixpapa.com/js/mouse.html">http://unixpapa.com/js/mouse.html</a>
for a summary of results of tests of mouse events on different browsers.
